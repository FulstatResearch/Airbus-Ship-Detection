# Airbus Ship Detection
## Required: 
Locate ships in images, and put an aligned bounding box segment around the ships you locate. Many images do not contain ships, and those that do may contain multiple ships. Ships within and across images may differ in size (sometimes significantly) and be located in open sea, at docks, marinas, etc.
